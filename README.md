# Sheep may safely graze
A very small prototype which can be considered a gameplay implementation of the winding number algorithm (used here to detect whether an object is inside a polygon or not).
The game goal is simply to build an enclosure containing all the sheep, while keeping them safe from the dark sheep wandering around.

**The game is playable on its [itch.io page](https://sixrobin.itch.io/sheepmaysafelygraze).**
